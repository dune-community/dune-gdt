[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dune-community/dune-gdt.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dune-community/dune-gdt)

dune-gdt is a [DUNE](http://www.dune-project.org/) module which provides a generic
discretization toolbox for grid-based numerical methods. It contains building blocks - like
local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers - for discretization methods and suitable
discrete function spaces.

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
[dune-gdt-super](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-gdt-super). Experienced DUNE users
may go ahead. As usual, you will have to use
[dunecontrol](https://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation/), working examples are located
in 'dune/gdt/test/'...
