dune-gdt is a [DUNE](http://www.dune-project.org/) module which provides a generic
discretization toolbox for grid-based numerical methods. It contains building blocks - like
local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers - for discretization methods as well as
generic interfaces for objects like discrete function spaces and basefunction sets.
