[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dune-community/dune-gdt.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dune-community/dune-gdt)

dune-gdt is a DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org) module which provides a
generic discretization toolbox for grid-based numerical methods. It contains
building blocks - like local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers -
for discretization methods as well as generic interfaces for objects like
discrete function spaces and basefunction sets. Implementations are provided
using the main DUNE discretization modules, like dune-fem
(http://dune.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/), dune-fem-localfunctions
(http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-fem-localfunctions) and
dune-pdelab (http://www.dune-project.org/pdelab/).

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
dune-gdt-super (https://github.com/dune-community/dune-gdt-super).
Experienced DUNE users may go ahead. As usual, you will have to call
configure and make using dunecontrol
(see http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html), working
examples are located in 'dune/gdt/test/'...
